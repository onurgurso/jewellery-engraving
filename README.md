[Top Jewellery](https://www.topjewellery.co.uk/)â€™s management aims to create a better user experience for their customers by giving them the option to engrave their jewellery by visualising it first directly on the product.

## Goals

The goal is for customers to envision their engraving on products like [signet rings](https://www.topjewellery.co.uk/product-category/mens-shop/signet-rings/), [wedding bands](https://www.topjewellery.co.uk/product-category/gold-wedding-bands/), [id bracelets](https://www.topjewellery.co.uk/product-category/mens-shop/bracelet-gold-silver-diamond/id-bracelets/) or [bangles](https://www.topjewellery.co.uk/product-category/womens-jewellery/bangles-in-9ct-gold-yellow-gold/).

The ecom-managers will also have the options to price items or categories differently and handle the the placement of the engravable areas of the products.
